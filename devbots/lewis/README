Lewis, hello. I am the delayed-gratification monkey. I have taken over for the instant-gratification monkey. Your brain has been steered by that bafoon for too long. Here's the scoop:

You will now be putting a 

'''
NOTES:

'''

Section in the top of all of your foodbots, but after the imports. You will also no longer work on bots for longer than an hour.

Your workflow looks as such:

1) Move devbot into your devbot/lewis directory
2) Open the file in your text editor of choice
3) Add your NOTES Section
	- Document the URL you are targeting
	- Document the Query that you are sending to the URL for data
	- Document the Date, as well as your Name (if you forget your name, please consult the long-term-memory elephant, your brain's specialist in such dealings)
4) In a seperate window, run the foodbot <- Crucial
5) Assess the runtime performance of the foodbot
	- Did it run?
	- Is the bot grabbing data?
	- Are there errors?
	- What are the errors?
6) Investigate why the foodbot may not be behaving well
7) Assign a Time Estimate to the foodbot in the notes section, along with notes as to why you think it will take the amount of time as estimated.
8) If Not Working on Bot && Time Estimate < 1 Hour, work on bot
	- Elif Working on Bot && Time is Up, take detailed notes about where you are stuck, and move bot back to devbots or badbots dependant on behavior
	- Else, move bot back to devbots or badbots dependant on behavior
